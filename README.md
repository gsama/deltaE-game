# 🎨 DeltaE Color Game

*A color perception game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.*

## 📖 About
DeltaE Color Game challenges your color vision by testing whether you can spot the odd tile in a grid.  
The difference between the colors is measured using **ΔE (Delta-E)** based on the **CIEDE2000** formula.

- Each level gets harder:
  - ΔE decreases (colors get closer).
  - Grid size increases.
